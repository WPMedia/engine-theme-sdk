# Engine SDK 

<Version />

Itâ€™s a collection of React components designed to:

- Speed up design and development velocity
- Help create consistent and usable functionality in our various websites
- Promote best practices for accessibility and responsive web design

We hope to accomplish these goals by:

- Reducing the number of decisions needed when iterating on UI
- Reducing the amount of code duplication in our apps
- Providing easy-to-use and extensible components for anyone to consume

and use them like so

```
  <ImageMetadata subtitle={subtitle} caption={caption} credits={credits} />
```

add engine-theme-sdk yo your block's `package.json` dependencies

```
"dependencies": {
    "@wpmedia/engine-theme-sdk": "latest"
  },
```


### **Local Development**

You can test Engine SDK components locally by adding the following properties to yout blocks.json:
-  `"useLocal": true`
-  `"useLocalEngineSDK": true`

## How To Publish

1. Pull the latest `staging` branch.

    - `git checkout staging`

    - `git fetch -a`

2. Branch off the `staging` branch

    - `git checkout -b PEN-[jira ticket num]-[brief description of feature]`

3. Do the work, commit as you go, which will run the linter and tests.

4. Make pull request using GitHub against the   staging` branch. 

    - Get approval for your pr on your feature branch.

5. Merge into `staging` branch.

    - `npm version prerelease --preid=beta`

    - `npm publish --tag beta`

6. Go to new theme feature pack's `blocks.json`
    - Change your engine block to the `@beta` release in the blocks list (eg, `"@wpmedia/header-nav"` -> `"@wpmedia/header-nav@beta"`).
    - Make a pr against the news theme repo making that change to the `master` branch. 
    - Then publish that change using deployment strategy to the `staging` environment (corecomponents prod is a `staging` env). 
    - Alert quality assurance stakeholder that the change has been published.

7. After design qa and qa approval, make a pull request from the `staging` branch to the `master` branch. (Should we make a new pr for just your staging changes?)

8. Once the pr has been approved, merge your feature staging branch to `master`. 
    - In master, you can publish against what's changed. (This could be done at the end of a sprint.)
    - `npm publish`
