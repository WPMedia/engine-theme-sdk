# Engine SDK 

<Version />

Itâ€™s a collection of React components designed to:

- Speed up design and development velocity
- Help create consistent and usable functionality in our various websites
- Promote best practices for accessibility and responsive web design

We hope to accomplish these goals by:

- Reducing the number of decisions needed when iterating on UI
- Reducing the amount of code duplication in our apps
- Providing easy-to-use and extensible components for anyone to consume

## How To Publish

1. Pull the latest `staging` branch.

    - `git checkout staging`

    - `git fetch -a`

2. Branch off the `staging` branch

    - `git checkout -b PEN-[jira ticket num]-[brief description of feature]`

3. Do the work, commit as you go, which will run the linter and tests.

4. Make pull request using GitHub against the   staging` branch. 

    - Get approval for your pr on your feature branch.

5. Merge into `staging` branch.

    - `npm version prerelease --preid=beta`

    - `npm publish --tag beta`

6. Go to new theme feature pack's `blocks.json`
    - Change your engine block to the `@beta` release in the blocks list (eg, `"@wpmedia/header-nav"` -> `"@wpmedia/header-nav@beta"`).
    - Make a pr against the news theme repo making that change to the `master` branch. 
    - Then publish that change using deployment strategy to the `staging` environment (corecomponents prod is a `staging` env). 
    - Alert quality assurance stakeholder that the change has been published.

7. After design qa and qa approval, make a pull request from the `staging` branch to the `master` branch. (Should we make a new pr for just your staging changes?)

8. Once the pr has been approved, merge your feature staging branch to `master`. 
    - In master, you can publish against what's changed. (This could be done at the end of a sprint.)
    - `npm publish`

## Deploy to ALC

Engine Theme SDK autoamatically deployes to ALC.
Engine SDK documentation is available [here](https://staging.arcpublishing.com/alc/docs/storybooks/engine-theme-sdk/?path=/story/intro--page). To update the documentation on Arc Learning Center you have to upload it to S3 by following these steps:
1. Run `npm run build-storybook` on `engine-theme-sdk`. This will generate a static storybook build in `/storybook-static`.
2. Open the [WP-ARC AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/arc-learning-center-static/docs/?region=us-east-1&tab=overview#) (you might need to authenticate with OKTA first).
3. Go to `storybooks`, then `engine-theme-sdk` and click on `Upload`.
4. Upload your files to replace the contents of `engine-theme-sdk` with your new build. Make sure to include the `sb_dll` folder generated in the build.
5. Click on `Next` and go through the uploading process with the default settings.
6. After a minute your changes will be live on [ALC](https://staging.arcpublishing.com/alc/docs/storybooks/engine-theme-sdk/?path=/story/intro--page).
